# Not-So-Basic-CAD

This repository hold the techniques and final designs of four assignment in CAD.

Assignment #1: Sweeps and Lofts

Focus: Design a hammer head using the sweep and loft tools to give the hammer head the correct curve and indent. The second part of 
of the assignment has you designing a candelstick holder, using a sweep to get the curve of the handle right.

End Result: 

Challenges:I had trouble getting the candelstick handle perfect( the handle would extrude and sweep, but wouldn't fit and lock into the main body of the holder.) Getting the cut/indent on the bottom of the hammer head was also hard to get. I had to align the triangle and rectangle I was extruding perfectly, or it wouldn't loft the cut.

Assignment #2: A Little Practice

Focus: These two assignment are a reintroduction to Solidworks and CAD. I had to design a circular pressure plate, and a rounded, hollow block, with a extruded hole on the top.

End Result:

Challenges:
